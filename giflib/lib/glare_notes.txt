These files were originally .c files.
I changed the extension to .cpp so they would compile as c++ files.
This is need on windows as they use 'bool', which is only valid c in c99, which VS doesn't support.

I also had to comment out a few includes of C99 header files.
See gif_hash.h:
//#include <unistd.h> // glare new - commented out
