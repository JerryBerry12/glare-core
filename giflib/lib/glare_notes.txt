These files were originally .c files.
I changed the extension to .cpp so they would compile as c++ files.
This is needed on windows as they use 'bool', which is only valid c in c99, which VS doesn't support.
(in vs2010 at least.  I think vs2015 and later do support c99)

I also had to comment out a few includes of C99 header files.
See gif_hash.h:
//#include <unistd.h> // glare new - commented out
